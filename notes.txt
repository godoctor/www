The go directory contains source code for the Go standard library, since
$GOROOT is not readable on Google's App Engine servers.

The app.yaml file excludes the go directory from the App Engine build -- see
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-appengine-go/PGA26s-Q0NQ

The go directory was created by unzipping go1.4.2.src.tar.gz and then editing:

rm -rf .hgignore .hgtags AUTHORS CONTRIBUTORS README api doc favicon.ico include lib misc robots.txt test
cd src
rm -rf ./{api,doc,favicon.iso,include,lib,misc,robots.txt,test}
find . -iname '*_test.go' -delete
find . -iname '*.c' -delete
find . -iname '*.h' -delete
find . -iname '*.s' -delete
rm -rf ./cmd/
for dir in `find . -iname testdata`; do rm -rf "$dir"; done
find . -iname '*.ico' -delete
find . -iname '*.bash' -delete
find . -iname '*.sh' -delete
find . -iname '*.zip' -delete
find . -iname '*.out' -delete
find . -iname '*.bat' -delete
find . -iname '*.rc' -delete
